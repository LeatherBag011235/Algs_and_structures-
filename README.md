# Algs_and_structures-
Hello, visiter! 

Here you can find my solutions for leetcode questions. 

They are organized by thematic directories and each name of the file contain {original number of the question on leetcode}_{original name}. I borrowed the structure from algomap.io If you are about to start to learn algorithms and data structures, I highly recommend you to visit this site (by the moment, it is completly free of charge).

Each file include my own solution that I came up with, and somtimes (in case its not fast and efficient enough) I add best soulution that I found on leetcode. Feel free to check and use the code or ask about the solution.

Enjoy!
Best luck!
